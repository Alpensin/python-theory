# 1114. Print in Order on LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/problems/print-in-order/)
## Task
Suppose we have a class:
```
public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
```
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().

Note:

We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the numbers in the input seem to imply the ordering. The input format you see is mainly to ensure our tests' comprehensiveness.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
 

Constraints:

nums is a permutation of [1, 2, 3].
```
## Answer (https://leetcode.com/problems/print-in-order/discuss/335939/5-Python-threading-solutions-(Barrier-Lock-Event-Semaphore-Condition)-with-explanation)
Raise two barriers. Both wait for two threads to reach them.

First thread can print before reaching the first barrier. Second thread can print before reaching the second barrier. Third thread can print after the second barrier.
```python
from threading import Barrier

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.first_barrier = Barrier(2)
        self.second_barrier = Barrier(2)
            
    def first(self, printFirst):
        printFirst()
        self.first_barrier.wait()
        
    def second(self, printSecond):
        self.first_barrier.wait()
        printSecond()
        self.second_barrier.wait()
            
    def third(self, printThird):
        self.second_barrier.wait()
        printThird()
```
Start with two locked locks. First thread unlocks the first lock that the second thread is waiting on. Second thread unlocks the second lock that the third thread is waiting on.

```python
from threading import Lock

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locks = (Lock(),Lock())
        self.locks[0].acquire()
        self.locks[1].acquire()
        
    def first(self, printFirst):
        printFirst()
        self.locks[0].release()
        
    def second(self, printSecond):
        with self.locks[0]:
            printSecond()
            self.locks[1].release()
            
            
    def third(self, printThird):
        with self.locks[1]:
            printThird()
```
Set events from first and second threads when they are done. Have the second thread wait for first one to set its event. Have the third thread wait on the second thread to raise its event.

```python
from threading import Event

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.done = (Event(),Event())
        
    def first(self, printFirst):
        printFirst()
        self.done[0].set()
        
    def second(self, printSecond):
        self.done[0].wait()
        printSecond()
        self.done[1].set()
            
    def third(self, printThird):
        self.done[1].wait()
        printThird()
```
Start with two closed gates represented by 0-value semaphores. Second and third thread are waiting behind these gates. When the first thread prints, it opens the gate for the second thread. When the second thread prints, it opens the gate for the third thread.

```python
from threading import Semaphore

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gates = (Semaphore(0),Semaphore(0))
        
    def first(self, printFirst):
        printFirst()
        self.gates[0].release()
        
    def second(self, printSecond):
        with self.gates[0]:
            printSecond()
            self.gates[1].release()
            
    def third(self, printThird):
        with self.gates[1]:
            printThird()
```
Have all three threads attempt to acquire an RLock via Condition. The first thread can always acquire a lock, while the other two have to wait for the order to be set to the right value. First thread sets the order after printing which signals for the second thread to run. Second thread does the same for the third.
```python
from threading import Condition

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.exec_condition = Condition()
        self.order = 0
        self.first_finish = lambda: self.order == 1
        self.second_finish = lambda: self.order == 2

    def first(self, printFirst):
        with self.exec_condition:
            printFirst()
            self.order = 1
            self.exec_condition.notify(2)

    def second(self, printSecond):
        with self.exec_condition:
            self.exec_condition.wait_for(self.first_finish)
            printSecond()
            self.order = 2
            self.exec_condition.notify()

    def third(self, printThird):
        with self.exec_condition:
            self.exec_condition.wait_for(self.second_finish)
            printThird()
```
